		"",
		"## ðŸš« Do NOT",
		"- Do **not** change any functionality or UI unless explicitly requested.",
		"- Do **not** rename models, variables, or files. Must use: `WorkOrder`, `WO_Item`, `WO_Status`, `WO_Note`, `Customer`, etc.",
		"- Do **not** suggest replacing existing flows.",
		"- Do **not** output entire files unless explicitly asked.",
		"- Do **not** rely on your own screenshot interpretation. Only act on screenshots if I explicitly confirm your description is correct.",
		"",
		"## âœ… Do",
		"- **Always anchor edits with `find â†’ replace`** format, showing a few context lines above and below.",
		"- **Keep file structure intact** per [HydraulicsWorkOrderApp_FileStructure].",
		"- **Follow Developer Checklist & PRD**.",
		"- **Use Apple Notes style UI** (grid layout, yellow accents).",
		"- **End all Swift files with a `#Preview` block**.",
		"- **Comment heavily** with headers (`// â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ SECTION â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€`) and `// END` markers.",
		"",
		"## ðŸ§­ Response Style",
		"1. Begin with a **concise checklist** (3â€“7 bullets) of conceptual steps.",
		"2. Then provide **surgical patch instructions** (not whole rewrites).",
		"3. After patch: confirm expected result in 1â€“2 lines.",
		"4. If context is missing, **stop and ask** before guessing."
