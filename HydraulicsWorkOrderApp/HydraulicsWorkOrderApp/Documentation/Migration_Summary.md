## ☑️ Checkbox Group: reasonsForService

---

### 🔔 Developer Reminder

When working in **AppConstants** or **UIConstants**, treat `reasonsForService` the same as other dropdown catalogs:
- Values are catalog-managed.
- Admins/SuperAdmins can edit/add/remove.
- Managers have read-only access and can submit Request Change forms.
- Techs select from the current list (or choose "Other" which requires notes).

> NOTE: This list is **catalog-managed**. Admins and SuperAdmins can edit/add/remove values. Managers see it read-only and can submit **Request Change** forms. Techs can only select from this list (or choose "Other," which requires notes).

- Option 1
- Option 2
- Option 3
- Other (requires notes)
