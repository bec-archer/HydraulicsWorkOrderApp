# 🧾 Product Requirements Document

**Project:** Hydraulics Equipment Check-In iPad App
**Author:** Bec Archer
**Last Updated:** August 7, 2025
**Platform:** iPad & iPhone (SwiftUI frontend)
**Backend:** Firebase Firestore (primary), Firebase Storage for images, self-hosted backup

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Replace manual Apple Notes workflow with a shared, role-based app for checking in hydraulic equipment, tracking repairs, and managing records. Designed for field technicians with large fonts, minimal UI, and gallery-based work order views.

---

## 🎨 User Interface Style

The entire app will visually mimic the Apple Notes UI for user familiarity:

* Grid layout on iPad (like Notes cards)
* Clean sans-serif fonts
* Large tap targets for buttons and fields
* Yellow-accented highlights and buttons via `AppleNotesYellow.json` theme

## 🎯 Key Goals

* Technician-first workflow with idiot-proof intake
* Reliable offline use + automatic background sync
* Role-based access (Tech, Manager, Admin, Super Admin)
* Equipment tracking via QR code / RFID tag
* Support for multi-equipment check-ins
* Work Order notes and status updates with timestamps and author attribution
* Future Android compatibility

---

## 👥 User Roles & Login

### 🔐 Login System

* PIN-based login (4–8 digits), mapped to individual users
* Each user has:

  * `name`: Display name
  * `passcode`: 4–8 digit PIN
  * `role`: One of `tech`, `manager`, `admin`, or `superAdmin`
* Multiple users supported per role; only one Super Admin can be active at a time
* All actions are logged with name and timestamp

### 🔒 Role Capabilities

## 🏠 Active WorkOrders View

* iPad: grid layout (like Apple Notes)
* iPhone: list layout
* Each Work Order Card shows:

* Customer Name (tappable)
* Phone number (tap-to-call/text)
* Card thumbnails: show **up to 4 images** — the **first image** from up to four WO_Items (item create order)
> **Fallback:** If a WorkOrder has **no** items, the UI may use the WorkOrder’s `imageURL` as a temporary thumbnail. When items exist, always prefer item images.
* **Status dots:** per-item indicator dots appear in two places:
  - **Overlay**: top-right corner of each item image (one dot per WO_Item)
  - **Inline**: a summary row of up to 4 dots on the same line as the Work Order number
* Timestamp
* Flag icon (driven by **`isFlagged`** on WorkOrder)
* Work Order number: `YYMMDD-001`
> **Note:** The Active Work Order card does **not** show a `StatusBadge`. Badges apply at the **WO_Item** level or within detail views; the card uses indicator dots only.
**Policy:** The Active Work Order **card** uses **indicator dots** (overlay + inline) and **does not** show a `StatusBadge`. `StatusBadge` is shown on **Work Order Item rows** in the detail screens.
**Sort Order:** Flagged first, then oldest to newest

---

## 👤 Customer Lookup & Creation

* The **very first field** in NewWO_View is a **customer lookup**.
* As the tech types a name or phone number:

  * The app checks existing customers for matches (by name or phone)
  * If no match found: a **“+ Add New Customer”** button appears
* Tapping it opens `NewCustomerModalView`:

  * Autofills the field already typed (name or phone)
  * Remaining fields: Company Name, Email, Tax Exempt (toggle)
* Once saved:

  * New customer is added to Firebase
  * Modal closes and returns to NewWO_View form with customer attached
* Ensures no duplicate records and fast intake

---

## ➕ New Work Order Workflow

1. Tech taps “+ New Work Order”
2. Lookup or add Customer
3. For each equipment:
   * Attach + scan QR code(s) (Add QR for additional tags; or select reason for bypass)
   * (Optional) Set a Position Label on each tag (e.g., A/B/C, Left/Right, Rod/Cap) to guide reassembly
   * Take at least one photo
   * Select dropdowns (type, color, size, brand, etc.)
   * Select reason(s) for service
   * Add optional notes
   * Save → becomes a `WorkOrderItem`
4. When all equipment is entered, tap **Check In Work Order**

✅ Status is auto-marked "Checked In"
✅ WorkOrder appears in active list with first photo as card thumbnail

---

## 🧑‍🔧 Tech Workflow + Status Handling

* Scan QR → opens WorkOrderItem
* From item detail, use **Add QR** to bind auxiliary tags and (optionally) set Position Labels
* Update status:

  * In Progress
  * Work Order Item Done

### ✅ If PASS:

* Enter:

  * Parts Used
  * Hours Worked
  * WO_Item Cost
  * Tap **Mark Work Order as Completed** (sets WorkOrder **`isCompleted` / `completedAt`** as a roll-up)
  * In Active view, the card appears **gray** (Completed)

### ❌ If FAIL:

* Enter Failure Reason
* If tech entering FAIL ≠ last updater:

  * Last updater receives alert on next login
* If second failure:

  * Item flagged as **“PROBLEM CHILD”**
  * Push alert sent to Managers

---

## 📋 Notes & History Tracking

* WorkOrder-level notes are stored as a subcollection:
  * `/workOrders/{woId}/workOrderNotes/{noteId}` (userId/userName + timestamp)
* Item-level notes are stored per item:
  * `/workOrders/{woId}/items/{itemId}/itemNotes/{noteId}`
* `NotesTimelineView` merges **workOrderNotes**, **itemNotes**, and each item’s **statusHistory** into a single timeline (newest first). 
* All entries are **timestamped** and **attributed** to the user.

---

## 👨‍💼 Manager Review

* Can view/edit parts/hours/notes
* Can optionally mark WO as completed
* Required to address 2nd-fail "PROBLEM CHILD" flags

---

## 📑 Work Order Deletion

* Restore/Delete WorkOrders
* **Data:** the Deleted view lists WorkOrders with `isDeleted == true`. Restore sets `isDeleted = false`.

---

## ✅ Work Order Closing

* After customer pickup/payment:

  * Any role may tap **Mark as Closed**
  * WO status changes to **Closed**
  * Closed WOs hidden from active list
  * Only Managers/Admins can view/reopen/edit

---

## 🔁 Status Log Example

```
Checked In by Maria @ 7:05 AM
Marked In Progress by Joe @ 8:12 AM
Seals Replaced by Joe @ 9:14 AM
Tested: PASS by Joe @ 9:25 AM
Parts/Hours/Cost entered by Joe @ 9:26 AM
Marked Completed by Joe @ 9:30 AM
Marked Closed by Maria @ 5:10 PM
```

---

## 🔎 Search

* Fuzzy search supports:

  * Customer name
  * Phone number
  * WO number
  * Tag ID (active binding **or previous** via tag history)
  * Status

---

## 📥 Bulk Import (Customers)
Admin/SuperAdmin can import customers from CSV via CustomersView → “Import CSV…”. The importer validates headers, normalizes phone (10 digits), and supports optional `emojiTag`. Rows preview as Create/Update/Error; errors must be fixed or skipped before import.

---

## 🔐 Completed vs Closed

| Status    | Who Sets It        | Visible To         | Behavior                          |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Completed | Tech/Manager/Admin | All roles          | WO turns gray in active view      |
| Closed    | Any role           | Admin/Manager only | Hidden from Active list, archived |

> **Data:** When “Mark Work Order as Completed/Closed” is tapped, set  
> the booleans **`isCompleted` / `isClosed`** and the timestamps **`completedAt` / `closedAt`**.  
> **Do not** set a WorkOrder `status` string. Lists and card styling derive from these flags (roll-up from items).

---

## 🧩 Backend & Storage

* Primary: Firebase Firestore
* Image Hosting: Firebase Storage
* Backups: Self-hosted export to `/sqlite_backups`
* Offline support: local queue with retry

---

## 🔄 Sync & Dev Tools

* Super Admin can:

  * Disable login or tag scan logic
  * Access dev panel & sync monitor
* Dev mode allows:

  * Testing WO_Number rollover at midnight
  * Reloading sample data on cold start
  * Verifying tag reassignment searchability (old + new IDs)

---

## 🔗 Multiple QR Codes per Item (NEW)

Some equipment requires more than one QR/RFID code to ensure correct reassembly (e.g., rod end vs cap end, left vs right, A/B/C pieces). The app must support **multiple tags bound to a single WO_Item**.

### Behavior
- **Many-to-one binding:** A WO_Item can have **multiple** tags attached.
- **Primary vs Auxiliary:** One tag may be marked **Primary**; all others are **Auxiliary**.
- **Position Labels (optional):** Each tag can carry a small **Position Label** (e.g., “A”, “B”, “Rod End”, “Cap End”, “Left”, “Right”) to guide reassembly.
- **Uniqueness:** A tag ID may be **active on only one WO_Item at a time** across the database.
- **Scan outcomes:**
  - If scanned tag is **already active on this item** → update “last seen” and proceed.
  - If scanned tag is **active on a different item** → prompt to **Reassign** it to the current item.
  - If scanned tag is **unbound/inactive** → **Bind** it to the current item (defaults to **Auxiliary** unless no Primary exists).
- **History:** All **bind / unbind / reassign** events are recorded with timestamp and user. (Existing single-tag replacement history remains; this section expands capabilities to multiple simultaneous tags.)

### UI Notes (scoped to item detail; high level)
- **WorkOrderItemDetailView** surfaces a **“QR Codes”** section that lists:
  - Each tag as a chip with: short tag ID • **Primary** badge (if applicable) • Position Label
  - Actions per tag: **Set Primary**, **Edit Label**, **Unbind**
- **Add QR**: button opens the scanner from the item context.
- **No changes** to card indicator-dot policy or StatusBadge placement elsewhere.

> This section is **additive** and does not change the existing **Tag Replacement Workflow** below.

---

## ♻️ Tag Binding & Reassignment Workflow

If a tag (QR or RFID) is damaged, missing, or reassigned:

* Manager/Admin can update **tag bindings** for a `WorkOrderItem` (reassign or replace the **Primary** tag, bind or unbind **Auxiliary** tags)* App prompts for:
  * **Old Tag ID** (autofilled)
  * **New Tag ID**
  * **Reassignment Reason**
* All changes are recorded to **tag history** (bind / unbind / reassign)
* Old tags remain searchable
* Role Required: Manager, Admin, or Super Admin

### 🔎 Tag Search Behavior

Searching by:

* ✅ Current tag (primary **or** auxiliary) → shows current WO_Item
* ✅ Previous tag → resolves to current WO_Item (via tag history)
* 🧭 If multiple tags match the same item, **dedupe to one result**
