## Instructions for Agent
*   You MUST read the file every time you need to touch it. YOU CAN NOT RELY ON YOUR "MEMORY" of having read a file at some point previously. YOU MUST READ THE FILE FROM DISK EVERY TIME! 
*   You MUST read the file BEFORE YOU TRY TO EDIT IT. Your edit WILL NOT APPLY if you do not read the file. 
*   To edit a file, READ the file so you have its state. EDIT the file precisely, ONLY changing EXACTLY what needs modified and nothing else. Then READ the file to ensure the change applied. 
*   DO NOT rewrite files or refactor functions unless explicitly instructed to. 
*   DO NOT write to a file you aren't explicitly instructed to edit. 
*   We use strict explicit typing everywhere, always. 
	* There are only two exceptions: 
		* We cannot strictly type Supabase clients
		* When we test graceful error handling, we often need to pass in malformed objects that must be typecast to pass linting to permit testing of improperly shaped objects. 
*   We only edit a SINGLE FILE at a time. We NEVER edit multiple files in one turn.
*   We do EXACTLY what the instruction in the checklist step says without exception.
*   If we cannot perform the step as described or make a discovery, we explain the problem or discovery and HALT! We DO NOT CONTINUE after we encounter a problem or a discovery.
*   We DO NOT CONTINUE if we encounter a problem or make a discovery. We explain the problem or discovery then halt for user input. 
*   If our discovery is that more files need to be edited, instead of editing a file, we generate a proposal for a checklist of instructions to insert into the work plan that explains everything required to update the codebase so that the invalid step can be resolved. 
*   DO NOT RUMINATE ON HOW TO SOLVE A PROBLEM OR DISCOVERY WHILE ONLY EDITING ONE FILE! That is a DISCOVERY that requires that you EXPLAIN your discovery, PROPOSE a solution, and HALT! 
*   We always use test-driven-development. 
	*   We write a RED test that we expect to fail to prove the flaw or incomplete code. 
		*   A RED test is written to the INTENDED SUCCESS STATE so that it is NOT edited again. Do NOT refer to "RED: x condition now, y condition later", which forces the test to be edited after the GREEN step. Do NOT title the test to include any reference to RED/GREEN. Tests are stateless. 
		*   We implement the edit to a SINGLE FILE to enable the GREEN state.
		*   We run the test again and prove it passes. We DO NOT edit the test unless we discover the test is itself flawed. 
*   EVERY EDIT is performed using TDD. We DO NOT EDIT ANY FILE WITHOUT A TEST. 
	*   Documents, types, and interfaces cannot be tested, so are exempt. 
*   Every edit is documented in the checklist of instructions that describe the required edits. 
*   Whenever we discover an edit must be made that is not documented in the checklist of instructions, we EXPLAIN the discovery, PROPOSE an insertion into the instruction set that describes the required work, and HALT. 
	*   We build dependency ordered instructions so that the dependencies are built, tested, and working before the consumers of the dependency. 
*   We use dependency injection for EVERY FILE. 
*   We build adapters and interfaces for EVERY FUNCTION.  
*   We edit files from the lowest dependency on the tree up to the top so that our tests can be run at every step.
*   We PROVE tests pass before we move to the next file. We NEVER proceed without explicit demonstration that the tests pass. 
*   The tests PROVE the functional gap, PROVE the flaw in the function, and prevent regression by ensuring that any changes MUST comply with the proof. 
*   Our process to edit a file is: 
	*   READ the instruction for the step, and read every file referenced by the instruction or step, or implicit by the instruction or step (like types and interfaces).
	*   ANALYZE the difference between the state of the file and the state described by the instructions in the step.
	*   EXPLAIN how the file must be edited to transform it from its current state into the state described by the instructions in the step. 
	*   PROPOSE an edit to the file that will accomplish the transformation while preserving strict explicit typing. 
	*   LINT! After editing the file, run your linter and fix all linter errors that are fixable within that single file. 
	*   HALT! After editing ONE file and ensuring it passes linting, HALT! DO NOT CONTINUE! 
*   The agent NEVER runs tests. 
*   The agent uses ITS OWN TOOLS. 
*   The agent DOES NOT USE THE USER'S TERMINAL.
